<h3>THE STRANGE TRACKS</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">There</span> was great excitement in the neighborhood
of Farmer Green's house. Rusty
Wren had found some strange tracks.
And nobody knew whose they were.</p>

<p>Now, when they were puzzled like that
the field- and forest-folk usually went
straight to Mr. Crow for advice. But
this time it happened that the old gentleman
had gone on an excursion to the
further side of Blue Mountain, where
Brownie Beaver lived. And there seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_2" id="p_2">p. 2</a></span>
to be no one else at hand who was likely
to be able to explain the mystery.</p>

<p>Being quite old, Mr. Crow was very
wise. And people often sought his opinion,
though later they fell into the habit
of consulting Daddy Longlegs upon matters
they did not understand. But this
was before Daddy was known in Pleasant
Valley.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Rusty Wren's news a
good many of his neighbors hurried to
the place where Rusty had noticed the
strange tracks.</p>

<p>"They were there in the dust of the
road," Rusty Wren explained to his
friends. "I could see them plainly, I assure
you. And there's no doubt that a
large company crossed the road right
here."</p>

<p>"Why can't we see the tracks now?"
several people wanted to know.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_3" id="p_3">p. 3</a></span>"A horse and wagon passed this way
and spoiled the footprints," Rusty said.</p>

<p>"They couldn't have been very big,"
somebody remarked.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;no!" Rusty Wren admitted.
"I shouldn't call them big. But they
certainly weren't as small as the footprints
of an ant."</p>

<p>When they heard that, some of Rusty's
friends looked relieved.</p>

<p>"We don't need to worry, anyhow," a
number of them said to one another.</p>

<p>But there was one that was disappointed.
That was Reddy Woodpecker.</p>

<p>"Why, the strangers&mdash;whoever they
are&mdash;are too small for me to fight!" he
cried. "And here I've wasted all this
time for nothing at all!" He looked so
angrily at Rusty Wren that Rusty felt
very uneasy. He certainly didn't want
Reddy Woodpecker to fight him!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_4" id="p_4">p. 4</a></span>Luckily Reddy did not attack Rusty.
But he went away grumbling. And Rusty
Wren couldn't help feeling a bit worried.</p>

<p>"Never mind what that rowdy says!"
little Mr. Chippy advised Rusty Wren&mdash;after
the quarrelsome Reddy Woodpecker
had gone away. "I'm glad you
told me about those strange tracks. I
live near-by, in the wild grapevine on the
stone wall; and I shall watch for more
tracks&mdash;and those that make them, too."</p>

<p>"Let me know when you learn anything
new!" said Rusty Wren. And Mr.
Chippy said that nothing would please
him more than to do just that.</p>

<p>Well, the very next day Mr. Chippy's
son, Chippy, Jr., knocked at Rusty
Wren's door (which was right beneath
Farmer Green's chamber window) and
told Rusty that he was wanted by the
roadside at once.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_5" id="p_5">p. 5</a></span>So Rusty flew straight to the stone
wall, where he found little Mr. Chippy
all aflutter. Mr. Chippy dropped quickly
into the road, pointing to some tiny
marks in the dust.</p>

<p>"Are those like the tracks you saw?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the very same!" cried Rusty
Wren. "And now you can see for yourself
that there must have been a crowd."</p>

<p>To his surprise Mr. Chippy shook his
head.</p>

<p>"There was only one person&mdash;&mdash;" he
said&mdash;"one person with eight legs!"</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?" Rusty
Wren asked him doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't think it. I <i>know</i> it!" Mr.
Chippy replied. "I've seen the person
six times to-day with my own eyes."</p>

<p>"What does he look like?" Rusty
Wren inquired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_6" id="p_6">p. 6</a></span>"Like nobody else I ever saw!" Mr.
Chippy exclaimed. "His legs are long
and thin; and his body is very small. And
though his mouth makes me think of a
pair of pincers, he seems quite friendly
and harmless."</p>

<p>"What's his name?" asked Busty
Wren.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Mr. Chippy.
"But there's only one name that fits
him. I've already called him by it. And
he seemed to like it, too."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Rusty persisted.</p>

<p>"Daddy Longlegs!" said little Mr.
Chippy.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>
<h3>THE NEW NEIGHBOR</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> the neighbors began to call him
"Daddy Longlegs." And anyone might
naturally think that he had lived in
Pleasant Valley a great many years.
But it was not so. Late in the summer
Daddy Longlegs had appeared from nobody
knew where.</p>

<p>Although people often inquired where
his old home was, he always pretended
that he didn't hear them&mdash;and began to
talk about the weather.</p>

<p>And as for Daddy Longlegs' new home
in Pleasant Valley, nobody knew much
about that either. No matter how curious<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_8" id="p_8">p. 8</a></span>
anyone might be, it did him no good at all
to ask Daddy Longlegs where he lived.
When prying persons put that question
to him, Daddy Longlegs always waved
his eight legs in every direction and answered
"Over there!"</p>

<p>Of course such a reply told nothing to
anyone. And it led to a good many disputes
among Daddy Longlegs' neighbors.
No two could ever agree as to which of
Daddy's legs really pointed toward the
place where he dwelt.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the wily gentleman was frequently
seen scrambling about the stone
wall by the roadside, near Farmer
Green's house. And little Mr. Chippy,
who made his home in the wild grapevine
that grew on the wall, always
claimed that Daddy Longlegs was a
neighbor of his.</p>

<p>"He's a good neighbor, too," Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_9" id="p_9">p. 9</a></span>
Chippy told his friends. "He's very
quiet and he never quarrels. And he's
always pleasant and ready for a chat.
It's too bad that he's deaf. I've asked
him at least a dozen times how old he is;
but he never seems to hear me."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow, who liked nothing better
than prying into other people's affairs,
slowly shook his head at that. And
coughing slightly he remarked in a hoarse
voice that there must be <i>reasons</i> why
Daddy Longlegs wouldn't tell where he
came from, nor where he was living, nor
how old he was.</p>

<p>But Mr. Crow wouldn't say what he
thought might be the reasons. Although
he was a wise bird, there were some
things he didn't know.</p>

<p>Now, in a way Mr. Crow was right.
Daddy Longlegs had the best of reasons
for keeping some facts to himself. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_10" id="p_10">p. 10</a></span>
the first place, he had never lived anywhere
except in Pleasant Valley. In the
second place, he was scarcely more than
two months old when people began to
notice him in the neighborhood of the
stone wall. And in the third place, since
he was somewhat timid he thought it just
as well if people didn't know where he
made his home.</p>

<p>He was&mdash;as his friends often said&mdash;an
odd person. For instance, he had always
<i>looked</i> old, from the very first.
And when everyone began to call him
"Daddy" it was only to be expected that
he would not care to let people know
that he was not even a year old&mdash;instead
of ninety or a hundred, as they supposed.
Besides, probably nobody would have believed
the truth. So he never told his
age.</p>

<p>Indeed, there were some who claimed<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_11" id="p_11">p. 11</a></span>
that Daddy Longlegs must be much more
than only a hundred years old. They
thought that his queer, tottering walk
alone was enough to show his great age.</p>

<p>But it is not strange that his walk
seemed a bit uncertain. When a person
has eight feet it is to be expected that
he will have a little trouble managing
them. It is to be expected that he will
sometimes find himself trying to walk
off in several different directions at the
same time.</p>

<h3>MR. CROW IS DISPLEASED</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs</span> had such pleasant manners
that it was no time at all before his
neighbors agreed that he was a good old
soul. And everybody was glad to claim
him as a friend.</p>

<p>At least, everybody but Mr. Crow!
Mr. Crow soon found that people were
asking Daddy's advice on all sorts of
questions (because they thought he was
very old&mdash;and therefore very wise). And
Mr. Crow at once became so jealous that
he didn't know what to do. He began
making unkind remarks about his new
rival, saying that no matter how old a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_13" id="p_13">p. 13</a></span>
person might be, if he had a small head
and eight long legs it was not reasonable
to believe that he could have much of a
brain. Whenever anybody mentioned
Daddy's name, Mr. Crow would <i>haw-haw</i>
loudly and mutter something about "old
Spindley Legs!"</p>

<p>Mr. Crow had spent many summers in
Pleasant Valley. And during that time
he had advised thousands of his neighbors.
Indeed, he often boasted that if he
had a kernel of corn for every bit of advice
he had given away, he never would
have to wonder where he was going to
get his next meal.</p>

<p>When some friend of Mr. Crow's repeated
that speech to Daddy Longlegs,
he observed that Mr. Crow must be very
wise.</p>

<p>"No doubt&mdash;&mdash;" he added in his thin,
quavering voice&mdash;"no doubt Mr. Crow's<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_14" id="p_14">p. 14</a></span>
help would be worth a kernel of corn to
anybody who was in trouble. If his advice
was good, no one would object to
paying for it. And if it proved to be bad,
no one would miss a kernel of corn."</p>

<p>It happened that Daddy Longlegs'
comment soon reached the ears of old
Mr. Crow. And it made that gentleman
furious.</p>

<p>"This is the first time anybody has
suggested that my advice is not always
first-class!" he croaked. "Here's this
long-legged upstart interfering in my
affairs. I must teach him a lesson!" Mr.
Crow declared.</p>

<p>Well, that very afternoon he challenged
Daddy Longlegs to a contest.</p>

<p>"I intend to prove," said Mr. Crow,
"that my advice is always good; and that
yours is always bad."</p>

<p>"Very well!" Daddy Longlegs an<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_15" id="p_15">p. 15</a></span>swered.
"But I advise you to go home
at once, Mr. Crow. You're very hoarse.
And I'm sure you ought to be in bed."</p>

<p>Now, the old gentleman was always
hoarse. And since he disliked to have
anyone mention his infirmity, his eyes
snapped angrily.</p>

<p>"I advise you&mdash;&mdash;" he roared&mdash;&mdash;"I
advise you to keep your advice to yourself."</p>

<p>Of course that was a rude speech. But
Daddy Longlegs did not take offense at
it. He straightway told Mr. Crow that
he ought to wear rubbers. And Mr.
Crow was so enraged that he couldn't
speak for as much as half an hour.</p>

<p>It was understood that the contest between
Daddy and Mr. Crow would take
place the following morning. And when
that time came a big crowd had gathered
upon the stone wall to see the fun.</p>

<h3>THE CONTEST</h3>


<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">My</span> cousin, Jasper Jay, has kindly consented
to ask us some questions," Mr.
Crow informed Daddy Longlegs. "And
he will decide which of us makes the
wiser answers."</p>

<p>Buster Bumblebee, who was watching
and listening, said:</p>

<p>"That's hardly fair, it seems to me."</p>

<p>But old Mr. Crow quickly told him that
he was a stupid fellow and that he'd better
keep still. And since a good many
other people had frequently said the
same thing to that young gentleman, Buster
began to think there might be some<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_17" id="p_17">p. 17</a></span>
truth in it. So he said nothing more.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Daddy Longlegs beamed
upon all the company. And Mr. Crow
looked at him out of the corner of his eye.
Then he said to Daddy, "I suppose you've
no objection to this plan?"</p>

<p>"It suits me very well," Daddy replied.</p>

<p>"I thought it would," said old Mr.
Crow with a smirk. And turning to his
cousin, Jasper Jay, he remarked in a low
voice that Daddy Longlegs was even duller
than he had imagined.</p>

<p>Then Jasper Jay announced that he
would put the first question. And after
he had heard Mr. Crow's opinion he
would listen to Daddy Longlegs'.</p>

<p>"When is the best time to plant corn?"
Jasper then asked Mr. Crow, while the
whole company craned their necks and
strained their ears&mdash;for of course they
didn't want to miss anything.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_18" id="p_18">p. 18</a></span>Mr. Crow made no answer for a few
moments. He appeared to be thinking
deeply. But at last he looked up and
said:</p>

<p>"The best time to plant corn is as
early as possible."</p>

<p>A good many of those present exclaimed
at once that that was a good
answer. And a few clapped their hands.</p>

<p>"What's your opinion?" Jasper Jay
then asked, turning to Daddy Longlegs.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs took off his hat,
mopped his narrow forehead with his
red bandanna, and then slowly nodded
his head three times.</p>

<p>"My answer is exactly the same as Mr.
Crow's," he piped in his queer, thin,
high voice.</p>

<p>At that a look of displeasure passed
quickly over the faces of the two cousins.
And when little Mr. Chippy called on<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_19" id="p_19">p. 19</a></span>
Jasper Jay to decide which was the better
answer, Jasper looked really worried.</p>

<p>"It's a tie this time," he said somewhat
sourly. And while everybody was
shouting, he and Mr. Crow withdrew to
one side and whispered, which some considered
to be rather bad manners.</p>

<p>Soon Jasper and Mr. Crow returned to
the eager throng. And Jasper now
looked as brazen as ever.</p>

<p>"I'll put the next question," he announced.
"And Daddy Longlegs may
answer first.... How many kernels of
corn make a meal!"</p>

<p>There wasn't a sound&mdash;except for Buster
Bumblebee's buzzing&mdash;as Daddy
Longlegs moved forward a few steps and
held his hand behind his ear.</p>

<p>"Speak louder!" somebody said to
Jasper. "You know he's hard of hearing."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_20" id="p_20">p. 20</a></span>So Jasper Jay repeated the question.
But Daddy Longlegs only looked at him
blankly.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that he couldn't understand
a single word that Jasper said.</p>

<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<h3>TOO MANY QUESTIONS</h3>


<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">This</span> is strange!" old Mr. Crow exclaimed,
looking very hard at Daddy
Longlegs. "You heard the first question
easily enough. But now you seem deaf
as a post."</p>

<p>And all the time Daddy Longlegs merely
smiled at Mr. Crow. He made no
comment at all.</p>

<p>"Don't you know what I'm saying?"
Mr. Crow bawled in his loudest tones.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a pleasant day," said Daddy
Longlegs. "But I'm afraid there's going
to be a heavy gale to-morrow."</p>

<p>"This is certainly peculiar," Mr. Crow<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_22" id="p_22">p. 22</a></span>
grumbled. And then little Mr. Chippy
hastened to explain that Daddy Longlegs
was often like that. He would appear to
hear you perfectly one moment. And
then&mdash;if you happened to ask him his
age, or where he came from&mdash;you might
find him unable to understand a single
word that you said.</p>

<p>"It's most unfortunate," said old Mr.
Crow. "I see nothing to do but reply to
the question myself. And then my
cousin, Jasper Jay, will decide which
has given the better answer&mdash;Daddy
Longlegs or I."</p>

<p>"Ah! But you can't do that!" cried
Daddy Longlegs suddenly. "Jasper Jay
said you were not to answer this question
until after I had. And you know you
mustn't break the rules of the contest."</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow's mouth fell open, he was
so astonished.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_23" id="p_23">p. 23</a></span>"Why, he can hear again!" he exclaimed.
And after staring at Daddy
Longlegs for a while he beckoned to Jasper
Jay. And again the two cousins
moved a little distance away and began
whispering.</p>

<p>When they returned both were smiling
broadly. And mounting the stone wall
once more, Jasper said that he would put
another question to Daddy and Mr. Crow,
and that they must both answer it at the
same time. Then he cautioned Daddy
Longlegs to speak up good and loud, because
Mr. Crow had a strong voice.</p>

<p>"I'd suggest&mdash;&mdash;" said Daddy Longlegs&mdash;&mdash;"I'd
suggest that Mr. Crow
speak as softly as possible, because my
voice is weak."</p>

<p>"That's only fair!" all the company
agreed, nodding their heads to one another.
But Mr. Crow appeared peevish.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_24" id="p_24">p. 24</a></span>"Everybody's against me," he grumbled.
"I almost believe&mdash;&mdash;" he said,
turning to his cousin&mdash;&mdash;"I almost believe
they're all in league with Farmer
Green."</p>

<p>"If you are not sure, why don't you
ask Farmer Green himself?" Daddy
Longlegs inquired.</p>

<p>"I will!" cried Mr. Crow in a loud
voice. "I'll ask him the next time I see
him."</p>

<p>"Then you can ask him now," said
Daddy Longlegs, "for here he comes,
with a gun on his shoulder."</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of Daddy's
mouth when old Mr. Crow began to beat
the air furiously with his broad wings.
He rose quickly&mdash;but not too high&mdash;and
made for the woods as fast as he could
fly.</p>

<p>"Now, that's strange!" Daddy Long<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_25" id="p_25">p. 25</a></span>legs
quavered. "I don't see how he's going
to talk with Farmer Green when he's
half a mile away from him."</p>

<p>And everybody else said the same
thing.</p>

<p>"He's gone off and left the contest unfinished,"
little Mr. Chippy observed.
"So there's nothing Jasper Jay can do
except to declare that Daddy Longlegs
is the winner&mdash;and the wisest person in
Pleasant Valley."</p>

<p>"I couldn't very well do that," Jasper
objected. "You're forgetting Solomon
Owl."</p>

<p>"Well, Daddy's wiser than old Mr.
Crow, anyhow," Mr. Chippy retorted.
And since almost everybody said that was
true, Jasper Jay didn't quite dare object.</p>

<p>But it was plain that he didn't agree
with the company. And he stamped his
feet and clashed his bill together and<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_26" id="p_26">p. 26</a></span>
shook his head as if he were much displeased.</p>

<p>He, too, began to believe&mdash;with his
cousin, Mr. Crow&mdash;that Daddy Longlegs
and all the others were on Farmer
Green's side.</p>

<h3>MRS. LADYBUG'S PLAN</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs'</span> neighbors took an even
greater interest in him, after his contest
with Mr. Crow. And much to Daddy's
distress they tried harder than before to
pry into his private affairs.</p>

<p>But those curious busybodies learned
very little. In fact there was only one
of them who really found out anything
about Daddy that was worth knowing.</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Ladybug, who was somewhat
of a gossip, discovered in some way
that Daddy Longlegs was a harvestman.
And she lost no time in spreading the
news far and wide. She even travelled as<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_28" id="p_28">p. 28</a></span>
far as the big poplar, to tell Whiteface,
the Carpenter Bee, what she had heard.</p>

<p>"A harvestman, eh?" said the Carpenter,
thrusting his hands into the pockets
of his apron. "If that's so, why doesn't
he go to work?" And without waiting
for an answer he dodged quickly inside
his house. He was building an addition
to his home; and naturally he was quite
busy. He knew, too, that Mrs. Ladybug
was a terrible talker.</p>

<p>"I declare, I hadn't thought of that!"
Mrs. Ladybug exclaimed. And then she
hastened to the stone wall to find Daddy
Longlegs and learn the answer to the
Carpenter's question.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ladybug soon spied Daddy, coming
from the orchard near-by. And since
she saw him before he saw her, he had
no chance to hide. He was sorry; for he
<i>just knew</i>&mdash;from the look in her eye&mdash;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_29" id="p_29">p. 29</a></span>
that she was going to ask him a question.
And sure enough, she did!</p>

<p>"You're a harvestman," she began,
quite out of breath from hurrying.
"Why don't you go to work?"</p>

<p>"What can I do?" Daddy inquired
with a blank look.</p>

<p>"Do!" she exclaimed. "I should think
Farmer Green would be glad to have your
help in harvesting his crops. He's mowing
his oats now. And there's no one to
help him except the hired man&mdash;unless
you count Johnnie, and <i>he</i> spends most
of his time at the swimming-hole."</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs thanked Mrs. Ladybug
politely for her suggestion. But he
said that he was not acquainted with
Farmer Green. And he disliked working
for strangers. And he thought he
would spend the rest of the summer making
friends with his neighbors.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_30" id="p_30">p. 30</a></span>"Next year," he told her, "I may
make some arrangement with Farmer
Green to work for him regularly."</p>

<p>But that answer did not satisfy little
Mrs. Ladybug in the least.</p>

<p>"You'd be far better off with something
steady to do," she insisted. And
she said so much that just to get rid of
her Daddy Longlegs promised to see
Farmer Green at once and offer his
services.</p>

<p>He was sorry, as soon as she had gone,
that he had agreed to do that. But being
a person of his word he never once
thought of not keeping his promise,
though he wished he had simply put his
hand behind his ear and not answered
Mrs. Ladybug's question at all.</p>

<p>But it was too late, then, to do that.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_31" id="p_31">p. 31</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<h3>TRYING TO HELP</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was true that Farmer Green had almost
more work than he could do just
then, even with the aid of the hired man
and Johnnie. And he often wished that
he might find somebody else to help him.</p>

<p>"I'd hire anybody I could find that
had two legs," he remarked to his wife as
he started away from the house after
finishing his dinner. "I want to get the
oats harvested before there's a rain.
And I don't like the looks of the sky
to-day."</p>

<p>Now, Daddy Longlegs reached the
farmhouse just in time to hear what<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_32" id="p_32">p. 32</a></span>
Farmer Green said. And he spoke up at
once&mdash;as loudly as he could.</p>

<p>"I'd be willing to work for you," he
said. "I'm a harvestman. And you
ought to be glad to hire me, for I have
eight legs instead of only two."</p>

<p>Perhaps Daddy's voice was too thin
and high for Farmer Green to hear.
Anyhow, he paid not the slightest heed
to Daddy's offer, but strode off across
the farmyard while his caller cried
"Stop! Please stop!" at the top of his
lungs.</p>

<p>Then Daddy heard a noise, which he
was sure was thunder&mdash;though it was
only Farmer Green calling to the hired
man to hurry.</p>

<p>"Well, I've tried to go to work, anyhow,"
Daddy Longlegs assured himself.
"And if the oats get wet Farmer Green
can't blame me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_33" id="p_33">p. 33</a></span>He went back to the stone wall then.
And seeing Mr. Chippy perched on the
wild grapevine, Daddy told him what had
happened. "Farmer Green must be deaf
at times, the same as you are," little Mr.
Chippy observed. "If I were you I'd
write him a letter."</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs pretended not to hear
Mr. Chippy's suggestion. The truth was,
being only a few months old Daddy did
not know how to write. But of course he
did not care to have Mr. Chippy know
that.</p>

<p>Well, while he pondered upon the situation
Daddy Longlegs changed his mind
about working for Farmer Green. In
the beginning he had not wanted to help
with the harvesting. He had taken up
Mrs. Ladybug's suggestion only to keep
her quiet. But now, having found that
going to work for Farmer Green was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_34" id="p_34">p. 34</a></span>
easy matter to arrange, Daddy Longlegs
began to long to do the very thing he had
wished to avoid.</p>

<p>At last he decided that he would go
over to the oat field at once and do what
he could to help with the harvesting&mdash;without
saying anything more to anybody.</p>

<p>"Farmer Green can't help but be
pleased," he thought, as he started off
across the farmyard in the same direction
in which Johnnie Green's father had
gone when he called to the hired man
to hurry.</p>

<p>Daddy had not gone far before he met
Buster Bumblebee. "How far is it to the
oat field?" Daddy asked him.</p>

<p>"Oh! It's not ten minutes' journey,"
said Buster. "I've just come from the
clover-patch myself; and that's twice as
far."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_35" id="p_35">p. 35</a></span>Daddy Longlegs thanked him. And
then he turned and tottered on again.
For a long time he walked as fast as he
could. It seemed to him that he must
have been travelling at least half an
hour. But he saw not the slightest sign
of the oat field, though he climbed a fence
and peered across the rolling meadow.</p>

<p>Then he happened to catch sight of
Chirpy Cricket hopping through the
grass. And Daddy called to him and
asked him how far it was to the oat field.</p>

<p>"It's a good half-day's journey from
here," said Chirpy Cricket cheerfully.
But Daddy Longlegs did not feel the least
bit cheerful when he heard that.</p>

<p>"For the land's sake!" he exclaimed.
"Are you sure you're not mistaken?
Buster Bumblebee told me a long time
ago that it was only a ten-minute trip."</p>

<p>"Ah! So it is&mdash;for him!" said Chirpy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_36" id="p_36">p. 36</a></span>
Cricket. "You must remember that he
flies very fast. But I have to hop along
much more slowly. And as for you, at
the pace you were travelling before you
stopped to speak to me you wouldn't
reach the oat field before to-morrow
morning! No&mdash;not even if you walked
all night!"</p>

<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<h3>IN NEED OF NEW SHOES</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs</span> couldn't help feeling
discouraged when Chirpy Cricket told
him that he wouldn't be able to reach the
oat field before the next morning.</p>

<p>"I declare," he said, "if I had known
it was such a long journey I wouldn't
have tried to go there to help Farmer
Green with his harvesting. I've already
walked so far that my shoes are all worn
out. And I can neither go on nor go
back until I get some new ones." He
looked very doleful&mdash;for he didn't know
what to do. But Chirpy Cricket laughed
merrily&mdash;as was his custom.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_38" id="p_38">p. 38</a></span>"Cheer up!" he cried. "You're in
luck! Jimmy Rabbit has a shoe shop in
this very meadow. Just follow me and
I'll show you where it is!"</p>

<p>So off they went. And soon they arrived
at the shoe shop, in front of which
they found Jimmy Rabbit all smiles and
bows.</p>

<p>"Here's a friend of mine who needs
some new shoes," Chirpy Cricket announced.</p>

<p>"Come right in!" cried Jimmy Rabbit.
"Any friend of Chirpy Cricket's is a
friend of mine too. And if I can't fit
your feet with shoes it won't be my fault.
Only yesterday I sold a pair of shoes to
old Mr. Crow. And his feet are enormous,
as every one knows."</p>

<p>"Well, I want more than just <i>one</i>
pair," Daddy Longlegs piped up. "I
want four&mdash;making eight shoes in all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_39" id="p_39">p. 39</a></span>
And I flatter myself that my feet are
very small," he added.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit looked a bit surprised
at that remark. He was not accustomed
to seeing eight-legged people in his shop.
But he made no comment, though he
couldn't help staring at his new customer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Chirpy Cricket had hopped
away, after telling Daddy that he was
leaving him in good hands. And then
Jimmy Rabbit went to work briskly. He
began setting shoes of all sorts and sizes
before Daddy Longlegs. And soon he
was not only placing them in front of
Daddy, but on both sides of him&mdash;and
behind him as well.</p>

<p>Jimmy Rabbit was so spry, and most of
the shoes were so big, that in no time at
all Daddy Longlegs was completely surrounded
by a wall of shoes, which rapidly
grew higher and higher.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_40" id="p_40">p. 40</a></span>"Stop! stop!" cried Daddy Longlegs.
But Jimmy Rabbit was so busy that he
didn't hear him. And he kept piling
more and more shoes around his tiny
visitor, until Daddy Longlegs was lost
in a small mountain of big, little, and
medium-sized shoes of many different
colors.</p>

<p>Not till then did Jimmy Rabbit pause
for breath. And when he saw that his
customer had disappeared he was more
than surprised.</p>

<p>"Where can he have gone?" Jimmy
exclaimed. "I didn't see him go out. He
was sitting right here only a moment ago.
And now he's certainly not in my shop."</p>

<p>Even at that very moment Daddy
Longlegs was frantically crying "Help!
help!" But his thin, weak voice was
quite muffled by the great heap of shoes
that buried him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_41" id="p_41">p. 41</a></span>After waiting for a few minutes Jimmy
Rabbit closed&mdash;and locked&mdash;his door,
and went skipping off to Farmer Green's
garden, where the cabbages grew.</p>



<hr class="chapter" />
<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_42" id="p_42">p. 42</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<h3>LOCKED IN!</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Poor</span> Daddy Longlegs! Buried as he was
under dozens of shoes&mdash;all of them many
times bigger than he was&mdash;he couldn't
help being alarmed when he heard Jimmy
Rabbit walk out of the shoe shop and
lock the door behind him.</p>

<p>Daddy wished that he had told Mrs.
Ladybug in the beginning that he
wouldn't help Farmer Green with his
harvesting. Then he would never have
started on his long journey to the oat
field and worn out his shoes. And if he
hadn't worn out his shoes, of course he
would never have visited Jimmy Rab<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_43" id="p_43">p. 43</a></span>bit's
shoe shop and got himself into such
terrible trouble.</p>

<p>He soon saw that he might call for help
until his voice was cracked worse than
ever without its
doing him the least bit
of good. So he stopped shouting and began
to climb out of the pile of shoes that
surrounded him. And he was very glad,
then, that he had eight long legs to help
him. But when he found himself free of
the shoes he seemed but little better off
than before. There he was, a prisoner in
the shoe shop! And the daylight was
fast fading.</p>

<p>If Daddy Longlegs had been half as
wise as his neighbors believed him he
wouldn't have stayed in his prison two
minutes. But after trying the door and
the two windows and finding that he
couldn't open them he made up his mind
that there was nothing for him to do ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_44" id="p_44">p. 44</a></span>cept
to wait until Jimmy Rabbit came
back the following day.</p>

<p>And there was the chimney all the
time! Daddy Longlegs could have
crawled up it just as easily as Santa
Claus could have crept down it! But because
he had never left anybody's house
or shop by way of the chimney, Daddy
Longlegs never once thought of doing
such a thing.</p>

<p>And his thinking that Jimmy Rabbit
wouldn't come back until the next morning
shows that Daddy knew very little
about the ways of his neighbors. Almost
anybody else would have been sure that
Jimmy Rabbit would keep his shoe shop
open at night, because he was always
wider awake after dark. And many
others of the field-people were exactly like
him in that respect.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs had been sleeping<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_45" id="p_45">p. 45</a></span>
soundly for some time&mdash;inside the toe
of a shoe&mdash;when the sound of voices
awakened him. At first he kept very still.
Being naturally a timid person he did
not want to show himself until he was
sure he was safe from harm.</p>

<p>And then, before he realized what was
happening, he felt himself picked up&mdash;shoe
and all&mdash;and he heard Jimmy Rabbit
say, "Try on this shoe, Peter Mink!"</p>

<p>Since there was no doubt&mdash;the next instant&mdash;that
Peter Mink was thrusting
his foot into Daddy's hiding-place, there
was only one thing for Daddy to do.
Knowing that he was in great danger of
being crushed, he withdrew into the very
tip of the shoe. And luckily for him,
Peter Mink's toes did not quite reach
him.</p>

<p>After that Daddy Longlegs could hear
nothing more; nor did he know what was<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_46" id="p_46">p. 46</a></span>
happening. But to make a long story
short, Jimmy Rabbit gave Peter Mink
another shoe&mdash;for Peter's other foot&mdash;and
bowed his customer politely out of
his shop.</p>

<p>After that Jimmy Rabbit promptly
locked the door again. But this time he
locked himself <i>in</i> instead of <i>out</i>. You
see, he never felt safe in Peter Mink's
company.</p>

<p>Naturally, Jimmy locked Daddy Longlegs
out of the shop, too, though he didn't
know it.</p>

<p>And there Peter Mink stood in the
moon-lit meadow, with his new shoes on
his feet, and with Daddy Longlegs hidden
in the toe of his right shoe.</p>

<p>But no matter if it <i>was</i> the right shoe,
Daddy Longlegs thought it was all wrong.</p>

<h3>RIDE BY MOONLIGHT</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was not exactly a pleasant ride that
Daddy Longlegs had in the toe of Peter
Mink's shoe. Not only was it dark
pocket inside the shoe, but it was so
cramped that Daddy was most uncomfortable.
And what was still worse, he
hadn't even the faintest idea where he
was going.</p>

<p>Sometimes Daddy was almost sure that
Peter Mink was carrying him around
Blue Mountain. And at other times he
thought that Peter must be following
Swift River&mdash;to see where it went, perhaps.
Anyhow, Daddy suffered such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_48" id="p_48">p. 48</a></span>
pitching and tossing and tumbling and
jouncing as he had never known in all his
life.</p>

<p>Then at last, to Daddy's great relief,
Peter Mink kept quite still for a long
time.</p>

<p>That was when Peter burrowed into a
haystack to take a nap. And since it was
then many hours past Daddy Longlegs'
regular bedtime, he went to sleep too.
But he awoke with a great start when
Peter Mink crawled out of his shelter
about dawn. And at first Daddy couldn't
imagine what was happening. But after
he had been bounced about a bit he remembered
the terrible accident that had
happened to him in Jimmy Rabbit's shoe
shop in the meadow.</p>

<p>Suddenly Peter Mink stopped. And to
Daddy Longlegs' great delight Peter began
to take off his shoes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_49" id="p_49">p. 49</a></span>Yes! Peter Mink removed his shoes.
And then he removed himself. That is
to say, he dropped his shoes carelessly
upon the ground (for that was his way!)
and took himself off.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs waited until Peter
Mink had stolen away. And then he
dashed out of the shoe much faster than
he had entered it the evening before.</p>

<p>Yes; the evening before! For now it
was the following morning&mdash;and broad
daylight.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs stretched his eight
legs, first one after another, and then all
together. He was so glad to escape from
his cramped quarters that he had little
thought for anything except the joy of
being free once more.</p>

<p>Then he remembered all at once that
he was lost. And that was enough to
start his eight legs to shaking beneath<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_50" id="p_50">p. 50</a></span>
him in a very unpleasant fashion. Daddy
Longlegs was frightened. Anybody could
have seen that.</p>

<p>After a few moments he looked about
him, wondering which way he had better
go. And as he gazed at his surroundings
he saw&mdash;not far off&mdash;a familiar
looking object.</p>

<p>At first Daddy could scarcely believe
his eyes. And he looked steadily at what
he saw, as if he half expected it would fly
away and vanish.</p>

<p>But the object did nothing of the kind.
And how could it, anyhow? Because it
was Farmer Green's house that had
caught Daddy Longlegs' eye.... And
there stood the great barn too, a little
way off! And there was the bridge across
Swift River!</p>

<p>Without knowing what he was doing,
Peter Mink had brought Daddy Long<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_51" id="p_51">p. 51</a></span>legs
almost home. And then he had taken
off his shoes because he wanted to go for
a swim in the duck pond, in the hope of
catching an eel for his breakfast.</p>

<p>Well, Daddy Longlegs lost no time in
making his way back to the stone wall by
the roadside. And the first person he met
there was no other than little Mrs. Ladybug,
who seemed delighted to see him and
asked him how he liked working for
Farmer Green.</p>

<p>"Yes! It's a fine day," said Daddy
Longlegs. "The rain is holding off. And
it looks as if Farmer Green was going to
get his oats harvested without their being
wet, after all."</p>

<p>"I see you're deaf to-day," Mrs. Ladybug
observed in a pitying tone. "It's a
shame. And Farmer Green ought to be
very grateful to you for your help."</p>

<p>"He hasn't said a word to me," Daddy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_52" id="p_52">p. 52</a></span>
Longlegs told her. And Mrs. Ladybug declared
she couldn't understand it.</p>

<p>But there were many other things, too,
that she didn't understand. She had
heard that Daddy was a harvestman. But
she didn't know that some people called
him by that name merely because he was
seen in Pleasant Valley about the time
Farmer Green harvested his crops. As
for working in the fields, Daddy Longlegs
knew no more about that than did
that fat drone, Buster Bumblebee. And
Farmer Green would have laughed heartily
at the idea of either of them helping
him.</p>

<h3>THE BIG WIND</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> several days after his unlucky journey
across the meadow, when he tried to
reach the field where Farmer Green was
harvesting his oats, Daddy Longlegs did
not wander far from the stone wall.</p>

<p>But one day Rusty Wren told him that
his cousin, Long Bill Wren, was going to
give a party at his house in the reeds on
the bank of Black Creek. And although
he had not been invited to the party,
Daddy Longlegs thought it would be
pleasant to go to it.</p>

<p>Accordingly he started off at once,
though the party was not to take place<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_54" id="p_54">p. 54</a></span>
until the afternoon of the following day.
But Daddy Longlegs knew that he was a
slow walker&mdash;and Black Creek was a
long distance away.</p>

<p>Now, it was a fine, beautiful morning
when Daddy set forth on his journey.
And he travelled steadily all day long
without meeting with an adventure of
any sort.</p>

<p>When night came he crept inside an
old fallen tree-trunk. And he went to
sleep feeling very happy, because he was
thinking what a good time he was going
to have at the party the next afternoon.</p>

<p>But when morning came, and Daddy
Longlegs crawled out of the hollow tree
to continue his journey, he had a great
disappointment. The moment he thrust
his head out of his hiding-place he knew
that he was in trouble. And he saw at
once that he would have to miss Rusty<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_55" id="p_55">p. 55</a></span>
Wren's cousin's party, because he certainly
couldn't go on, with the weather as
it was.</p>

<p>Yet the sun was shining brightly. And
there was scarcely a cloud to be seen in
the sky.</p>

<p>A person might naturally wonder, then,
what Daddy Longlegs could have found
to worry him. It wasn't raining. And it
certainly wasn't snowing, because it was
not much later than midsummer.</p>

<p>Nevertheless Daddy Longlegs looked
upon the fields with a most mournful
face.</p>

<p>"I can't travel in this terrible wind!"
he muttered. "If I had known there was
going to be such a blow I would never
have left home."</p>

<p>And now you know what Daddy's
trouble was. With his small body raised
so high in the air by his long, thin legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_56" id="p_56">p. 56</a></span>
he always found it hard to walk when the
wind was blowing a gale. The strong
gusts buffeted him about so that he
pitched and tossed like a chip on the mill
pond when its surface was ruffled. And
Daddy had learned quite early in his life
to seek some sheltered spot on windy
days, venturing forth only when the air
was calmer.</p>

<p>Of course it was never any too pleasant,
to be obliged to lie low like that,
when there were a hundred things he
wanted to do. But it was much worse
to be caught far away from home in a
terrible gale. Not only was there no
knowing how long he would have to stay
hidden in the fallen tree before he dared
begin his long homeward journey, but he
had no one with whom he could talk. And
it had always been Daddy's custom to
spend gusty days as agreeably as possi<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_57" id="p_57">p. 57</a></span>ble
by gossiping with his neighbors.</p>

<p>Besides, there was the party on the
bank of Black Creek! Daddy Longlegs
knew right away that it was useless for
him to try to attend it. And so it was
no wonder that he felt unhappy.</p>

<h3>GOOD NEWS ON A BAD DAY</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">For</span> a long time Daddy Longlegs lay inside
the hollow, fallen tree and looked
out upon the wind-swept fields. If the
stone wall hadn't been so far away he
would certainly have tried to return
home. But the weather was altogether
too dangerous. He knew it would be
risky to attempt so long a journey.</p>

<p>As he sat looking out of the chink in
the old tree, through which he had crept
inside it, Daddy suddenly saw a reddish,
brownish flash flicker past the opening.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" he exclaimed. "I wonder
what that was!" And in another moment
the same bright patch of color again
whisked across the hole.</p>

<p>Then Daddy Longlegs heard a sound<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_59" id="p_59">p. 59</a></span>
as of some one scratching upon the tree-trunk.
And being of a very curious nature,
he crawled half through the hole
and peered out to see what was happening.
Daddy Longlegs was all ready for
a fright. He was so upset, on account of
being caught away from home on a windy
day, that he was unusually jumpy and
fidgety. But&mdash;as it often happens at
such times&mdash;he met with a pleasant surprise.
For there sat Sandy Chipmunk,
with his long tail curled over his back,
and something very like a smile on his
bright face.</p>

<p>Knowing that Sandy Chipmunk never
harmed anybody that minded his own
affairs, Daddy Longlegs spoke to him at
once.</p>

<p>"It's a bad day, isn't it?" he called.</p>

<p>Hearing that tiny voice, which seemed
to come from inside the fallen tree, Sandy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_60" id="p_60">p. 60</a></span>
Chipmunk was so startled that he leaped
high into the air; and when he came down
again upon all fours he found himself
staring straight into Daddy Longlegs'
beady eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh! It's you, eh?" cried Sandy Chipmunk.
And he looked decidedly foolish,
because he knew that he had no reason to
fear anybody as mild as Daddy Longlegs.</p>

<p>"It's a bad day, isn't it!" said Daddy
Longlegs once more.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't agree with you,"
Sandy replied. "I think it's the finest
weather that ever was."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you like this
wind?" Daddy Longlegs cried. "Why,
I don't see how you dare to be out in it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's nothing when you're used to
it," Sandy Chipmunk answered lightly.</p>

<p>"I shall never get used to the wind,
I'm afraid," Daddy told him sadly. "It<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_61" id="p_61">p. 61</a></span>
blows me about so terribly." And he
went on to explain how he had started on
a long journey the day before, and how
he didn't dare go on&mdash;nor turn around
and go home, either.</p>

<p>"Well, well!" Sandy Chipmunk exclaimed.
"You seem to be in a fix. But
why don't you <i>ride</i> home?"</p>

<p>"Ride?" Daddy Longlegs shrilled.
"On what, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"On Farmer Green's wagon!" Sandy
told him promptly. "I happen to know
that Johnnie Green and his grandmother
drove to the miller's this morning to have
a sack of wheat ground into flour. And
they'll be coming back home this afternoon."</p>

<h3>A DANGEROUS BUSINESS</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sandy Chipmunk</span> did not tell Daddy
Longlegs how he had been tied up in the
sack of wheat and had had a ride in the
wagon himself. He did not like riding
in wagons. And he had been so glad to
escape from the sack and jump into the
bushes by the roadside that he had
stopped to dance on Daddy's tree before
scampering back home.</p>

<p>His suggestion took Daddy Longlegs
by surprise. At first he felt a bit timid
about riding in a wagon. But Sandy
Chipmunk assured him it was not half
as bad as it was said to be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_63" id="p_63">p. 63</a></span>"Is it far to the road?" Daddy asked
him.</p>

<p>"Not if you hurry," Sandy told him.
"If you start now you surely ought to be
able to reach the road by the time old
Ebenezer passes this field."</p>

<p>"Ebenezer! Who's he?" Daddy inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh! He's the horse that draws the
wagon you're going to ride in," Sandy
Chipmunk explained.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs thought deeply for a
few minutes&mdash;or as deeply as anybody
could who had so small a head as he. And
then he said:</p>

<p>"I'll try your plan, for I want to go
home. But it's very dangerous for me to
do so much walking on such a windy day
as this."</p>

<p>"Come on!" cried Sandy. "I'll show
you the way to the road." And having<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_64" id="p_64">p. 64</a></span>
started Daddy in the right direction, he
hastened off to the road himself, to wait
for the wagon.</p>

<p>Sandy waited by the roadside for a
long, long time. And while he was lingering
there, Daddy Longlegs was battling
with the wind and having hard
work to keep his feet. But by hurrying
along fences, and dodging behind bowlders
and bushes and every other sort of
shelter that he could find, Daddy managed
to reach the roadside at last, where
he arrived quite out of breath.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" Sandy Chipmunk shouted,
as soon as Daddy joined him. "Here you
are&mdash;and you're just in time! For
there's the wagon rattling down the next
hill. And old Ebenezer (that's the horse,
please remember!) he'll climb this rise
as fast as he can, because he's in a hurry
to get home."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_65" id="p_65">p. 65</a></span>"He can't be half as anxious to reach
home as I am," Daddy Longlegs remarked.
"And if he doesn't go his fastest
after I'm aboard the wagon I hope
Johnnie Green will whip him hard."</p>

<p>"Johnnie can't do that," said Sandy
Chipmunk. "His father won't let him
have a whip."</p>

<p>"Well, he could cut a switch, I should
think!" Daddy Longlegs exclaimed.</p>

<p>But Sandy shook his head.</p>

<p>"Johnnie's grandmother wouldn't let
him do that," he replied. "But you
don't need to worry. You'll get home
soon enough."</p>

<p>Soon the two watchers saw the old
horse Ebenezer come jogging up the road.
And then Sandy Chipmunk said something
that sent Daddy Longlegs into a
flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>"Here they come!" cried Sandy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_66" id="p_66">p. 66</a></span>
"You'd better stand right in the middle
of the road, so you'll be sure to stop
them."</p>

<p>And the mere thought of doing such a
dangerous thing as that made Daddy
Longlegs turn quite pale.</p>

<h3>ONE WAY TO STOP A HORSE</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Every</span> one of Daddy Longlegs' eight
knees began to shake, when Sandy Chipmunk
told him to stand in the middle
of the road, in order to stop the old horse
Ebenezer, who was pulling the wagon in
which Johnnie Green and his grandmother
were riding.</p>

<p>"I can't do that!" Daddy shrieked,
shrinking away from the dusty road.
"I'm so small that they wouldn't see me
and the first thing I'd know I'd be run
over.... You'll have to stop the wagon
for me&mdash;you're so much bigger than I
am."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_68" id="p_68">p. 68</a></span>But Sandy Chipmunk said he didn't
like to speak to Johnnie Green, on account
of a little trouble he had had with
Johnnie's father over a letter.</p>

<p>"Can't you wave your tail at him?"
Daddy Longlegs besought him. "That
wouldn't be <i>speaking</i> to him, you know.
Wave your tail at Johnnie Green until
he stops the horse; and then you can run
away, if you want to. And while the
horse is standing still I'll scramble into
the wagon, without anybody seeing me."</p>

<p>Now, Sandy Chipmunk was a good-natured
person. And he saw that unless
the wagon was stopped, Daddy Longlegs
was going to be terribly disappointed.
So he told Daddy that he would do what
he could to help him.</p>

<p>Then Sandy leaped nimbly to the edge
of the watering-trough at one side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_69" id="p_69">p. 69</a></span>
road and began waving his tail backwards
and forwards, like a flag.</p>

<p>"That's right!" Daddy Longlegs shouted
approvingly. "But I wish you'd wave
a little harder. I'm afraid they won't see
you."</p>

<p>So Sandy Chipmunk redoubled his efforts.
And he wagged his tail so hard
that before he knew what was happening
he had lost his footing, slipped off the
edge of the trough, and found himself
floundering in the water.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs was watching the wagon
so anxiously that he never noticed what
was happening to his friend. But he observed
that Johnnie Green began to laugh.
And pointing toward the watering-trough
Johnnie cried, "Oh! look, Grandma&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>The old horse Ebenezer, too, seemed interested
in what was going on. Anyhow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_70" id="p_70">p. 70</a></span>
he swerved to the right and walked
straight up to the trough. And the wagon
came to a halt.</p>

<p>That was Daddy Longlegs' chance. He
hurried to one of the rear wheels. And
in spite of the wind he clambered quickly
up and hid himself in a corner of the
wagon-box.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sandy Chipmunk, spluttering
and choking, managed to pull himself
out of his unexpected bath and frisked
out of sight among the sumacs that
fringed the road.</p>

<p>"Well, I stopped the wagon, anyhow!"
he said to himself as he scampered
away.</p>

<p>And that was just where he was mistaken.
The old horse Ebenezer wanted a
drink. That was why he had paused at
the trough. He thrust his muzzle deep
into the cool spring-water and drank so<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_71" id="p_71">p. 71</a></span>
long that Johnnie Green began to be worried,
for fear he would burst.</p>

<p>But old Ebenezer wouldn't budge until
he had drunk his fill. When he was ready
(and not before) the wagon went rumbling
up the road again, taking Johnnie
Green and his grandmother home to the
farmhouse&mdash;and likewise bearing Daddy
Longlegs back to the stone wall, where little
Mr. Chippy lived in the wild grapevine.</p>

<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<h3>A CALL ON A NEIGHBOR</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs</span> was delighted to be at
home again. And Mr. Chippy&mdash;as well as
other neighbors&mdash;remarked that they had
never seen him so happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>Perhaps one reason for Daddy's good
spirits was the fact that the wind no
longer blew and he could venture abroad
without being buffeted about.</p>

<p>He was so relieved by the change in the
weather that it seemed to him there could
be no danger anywhere.</p>

<p>Little did Daddy Longlegs dream that
a great army was even then making plans
to capture him. And still less did he<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_73" id="p_73">p. 73</a></span>
imagine that he was going to meet with
a real adventure before the day was done.</p>

<p>Daddy Longlegs had so many pleasant
ideas in his head that there was no room
in it for any thought of danger. He had
found that his neighbors considered him
a hero, because he had ridden in Farmer
Green's wagon. A good many of Daddy's
friends rushed at once to the stone wall,
to talk with him&mdash;as soon as they heard
the news. And naturally he began to feel
quite important.</p>

<p>"Weren't you frightened?" people
asked him. "Weren't you afraid that
the horse would run away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I wasn't the least bit scared,
though I admit it was a dangerous feat,"
Daddy Longlegs told them. Then he
would strut and swagger about, trying to
appear as if there wasn't a braver person
than he in all Pleasant Valley. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_74" id="p_74">p. 74</a></span>
he talked about his wild ride to everybody
that would listen to him.</p>

<p>At first Daddy's friends enjoyed hearing
about his adventure. But he boasted
so much about his bravery that his listeners
soon grew tired of hearing him talk.
And instead of his having many callers,
it was not long before Daddy Longlegs
found that nobody came near him, even
to say howdy-do.</p>

<p>He endured his loneliness as long as he
could, though he found it hard not to talk
when he had so much to say. And feeling,
at last, that he was in danger of choking
over the babble that surged up from within
him, Daddy Longlegs decided that he
would go and call on Rusty Wren, who
lived in the cherry tree near Farmer
Green's bedroom window.</p>

<p>"Rusty will be glad to know of my ride
in the wagon," Daddy thought. "And be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_75" id="p_75">p. 75</a></span>sides,
I'd like to hear about his cousin's
party, which I missed on account of the
big wind." So off Daddy Longlegs started,
the moment the idea popped into his head.
He was the least bit uneasy, perhaps, for
fear Rusty Wren might not be at home,
in which case he would have nobody to
talk to except Rusty's wife. And everybody
knew that she was a person of uncertain
temper.</p>

<p>But Daddy found Rusty perched on the
tin roof of his house (his house was made
of a maple-syrup can). And the first
thing that Daddy Longlegs said to him
was this: "Is your wife at home?"</p>

<p>That may seem a strange question. But
Rusty Wren appeared to know what his
caller meant. Anyhow, Rusty said, "No!"
in such a cheerful tone that Daddy Longlegs
knew they could have a good chat
without being disturbed.</p>

<p class="chapter"><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_76" id="p_76">p. 76</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI</h2>

<h3>BOASTFUL TALK</h3>


<p class="noindent">"<span class="smcap">I suppose</span> you've heard of my great
adventure?" Daddy Longlegs began, as
soon as he learned that Rusty Wren was
alone&mdash;that is, alone except for his six
growing children inside the house. "No
doubt you know all about my daring
deed?"</p>

<p>"Why, no!" Rusty Wren replied, looking
at his caller with no little wonder&mdash;for
he had always believed Daddy Longlegs
to be one of the mildest and most
timid of all the field-people. "What have
you been doing?" Rusty asked.</p>

<p>"Something that you've never done!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_77" id="p_77">p. 77</a></span>
Daddy Longlegs told him proudly. "I
took a ride in Farmer Green's wagon yesterday,
after the old horse Ebenezer!"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! Go on!" Rusty urged him.
"What happened to you?"</p>

<p>"What happened to me!" cried Daddy
Longlegs. "I should think that <i>riding
in a wagon</i> was adventure enough for anyone,
without any other sort of danger
added to it."</p>

<p>But Rusty Wren didn't agree with him.</p>

<p>"Riding in a wagon is nothing," he declared.
"Farmer Green rides in one almost
every day. And as for it's being
dangerous, there's only the danger that
you'll be late arriving at the place where
you're going&mdash;especially if you have to
depend on old Ebenezer to take you. He's
several thousand times my size; yet I
can fly further in a day than he can trot
in two weeks."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_78" id="p_78">p. 78</a></span>Well, Rusty's scoffing remarks made
Daddy Longlegs quite peevish. He had
come to Rusty's house in order to boast.
And of course he was disappointed when
he found that Rusty Wren did not think
him a hero at all.</p>

<p>"We'll say no more about the matter,"
Daddy observed stiffly. "I can see that
you are jealous. And I always make it a
rule not to dispute with jealous people."</p>

<p>Rusty Wren couldn't help feeling
somewhat ashamed. He realized that perhaps
he had not been very polite to his
caller. "I meant no harm," he ventured
"And if you want to change the subject,
I've no objection."</p>

<p>"Very well!" Daddy Longlegs replied.
"Let's talk about your cousin's party at
Black Creek. I was sorry not to be present
at it. But the high wind prevented
me from travelling that day."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_79" id="p_79">p. 79</a></span>Then it was Rusty Wren's turn to look
disappointed.</p>

<p>"There wasn't any party," he said.
"Old Mr. Crow was mistaken. My cousin's
party took place exactly a year earlier.
So Mr. Crow was twelve months
late with his news."</p>

<p>When he heard that, Daddy Longlegs
couldn't help laughing right in Rusty
Wren's face.</p>

<p>"I don't see any joke," Rusty snapped.
"I can tell you that it's a good deal of a
disappointment to have your mind all
made up for a party, and then find that
there is none."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you're right," said Daddy
Longlegs. "Anyhow, I'm glad now that
there was a wind that day, because the
wind prevented my walking all the way
to Black Creek for nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, there's no wind now to keep you<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_80" id="p_80">p. 80</a></span>
from walking anywhere you want to go,"
said Rusty Wren slyly. He hoped that
Daddy Longlegs would take the hint&mdash;and
leave, for he did not care to talk with
him any longer. Besides, it was time for
Rusty to feed his six growing children.</p>

<p>Soon, to Rusty's relief, Daddy Longlegs
began to creep down the trunk of the
cherry tree.</p>

<p>If he had known what was in store for
him he might not have left just then.</p>

<h3>DADDY IS ATTACKED</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">When</span> Daddy Longlegs went to call on
Rusty Wren he did not know that a whole
army had planned to capture him. But
it was true, nevertheless, that a plot had
been hatched against him. Now, right beneath
the big old cherry tree where Rusty
had his home there lived a colony of ants.
And it was Rusty's habit&mdash;and his wife's,
as well&mdash;to enjoy an occasional meal (or
a light luncheon) by capturing and eating
such ants as were not spry enough to
keep out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Such actions only served to make the
Wren family heartily disliked by every<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_82" id="p_82">p. 82</a></span>
member of the ant colony. But there was
nothing the ants could do except to try
to be careful. And they were so angry
that since they were powerless to harm
the Wrens, they were quite ready and
eager to vent their spite on Rusty's
smaller friends.</p>

<p>That was the reason why they had determined
to attack Daddy Longlegs at
the very first opportunity.</p>

<p>Yes! The members of the ant colony
had made up their minds to capture
Daddy the next time he should visit Rusty
Wren. And the ant army of fierce fighters
was all prepared for a terrible battle.
Each day sentinels took their posts and
stayed on watch, ready to give the alarm
the moment Daddy Longlegs came hobbling
through the grass near the foot of
the cherry tree.</p>

<p>And when, at last, Daddy fell into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_83" id="p_83">p. 83</a></span>
trap, on the day that he visited Rusty to
boast about his wagon ride, the news of
his arrival spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>The ants had not said a word to Daddy
as he passed their home and climbed up
the cherry tree. They allowed him to go
unharmed. But while he was high up in
the tree chatting with Rusty Wren, ants
hurried back to their stronghold from
every direction. And in a surprisingly
short time the whole army was ready and
waiting&mdash;waiting for Daddy Longlegs to
descend to the ground.</p>

<p>When he had finished his call, Daddy
Longlegs left the cherry tree and started
homeward. But he had not gone more
than a few inches when the ant army
sprang out of the ground as if by magic.</p>

<p>The soldiers were all around Daddy before
he realized what was happening.
And then he saw that it was too late for<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_84" id="p_84">p. 84</a></span>
him to turn back and try to escape by
climbing the tree again.</p>

<p>Being a timid person, he took fright
at once. And looking up toward Rusty
Wren's house he cried, "Help! help!" in
a terror-stricken voice.</p>

<p>But Daddy's shrieks brought no answer.
Rusty Wren had flown away to find
food for his hungry children. The ant
sentinels had seen him leave. And they
knew that they had nothing to fear from
that quarter.</p>

<p>As the army closed in around him,
Daddy Longlegs thought that he had
never been in such danger in all his life
before. The army was so near him that
he could have seen the whites of the soldier's
eyes&mdash;if they had had any whites.</p>

<h3>THE ANT ARMY</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Urged</span> on by their leaders, the ant soldiers
dashed upon meek, frightened Daddy
Longlegs. On all sides they crowded
about him. And as he looked down at his
swarming enemies and saw how fiercely
they rushed at him, his knees began to
tremble just as they did when a strong
wind was blowing.</p>

<p>Poor Daddy stood helplessly waiting
for the worst to happen. He expected any
moment to feel himself pulled down and
thrown upon the ground. But strange to
say, in spite of the uproar and the mad<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_86" id="p_86">p. 86</a></span>
charge of Daddy's enemies, nothing of the
kind occurred. Soon it became clear that
the ant army was in some sort of trouble.
Although the leaders drove the soldiers at
Daddy Longlegs with frantic cries, the
army merely surged backwards and forwards
around him.</p>

<p>And Daddy had not received as much as
a slap on the wrist from a single one of the
attacking party.</p>

<p>Seeing that his forces were making no
headway against the enemy, General Antenna,
who commanded the entire army,
called to one of the captains.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Captain Kidd?"
the General demanded. "Our soldiers
don't seem to be doing any damage."</p>

<p>Of course, you must click your heels together
when a General speaks to you.
And naturally that took Captain Kidd
some time to do, because it is no easy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_87" id="p_87">p. 87</a></span>
matter to click your heels together when
you have six feet.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was only to be expected that
General Antenna should quickly become
impatient.</p>

<p>"Why don't you answer?" the General
shouted. "We'll lose the battle if we're
not careful!"</p>

<p>Then Captain Kidd had to stop and salute
the General. And that took time, too.
For how could anyone touch his cap when
he had lost it somewhere?</p>

<p>Luckily, General Antenna soon saw
what was the matter, and said:</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;take my cap!" And the General
promptly clapped a gold-braided cap
upon the Captain's head.</p>

<p>Then Captain Kidd was able to salute.
And after that&mdash;and not before&mdash;the
brave officer was ready to answer the General's
inquiry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_88" id="p_88">p. 88</a></span>Yes! Captain Kidd was all ready to reply.
But by that time the Captain had
quite forgotten what the question was.</p>

<p>Fortunately, General Antenna remembered&mdash;and
repeated&mdash;it.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" said the Captain. "The
trouble is this: Our soldiers can't reach
the enemy. Daddy Longlegs is so tall that
they can't touch anything except his
feet!"</p>

<p>Taking a careful look at the battle-field,
the General saw that it was so.
But still the commander of the army was
not dismayed.</p>

<p>"Can't you tip him over?"</p>

<p>"We've tried to already," replied Captain
Kidd. "But he has too many legs
for us."</p>

<p>"Can't your soldiers stand on one another's
shoulders?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_89" id="p_89">p. 89</a></span>"It's no use," the Captain answered.
"We've tried that too."</p>

<p>General Antenna began to look somewhat
worried, knowing that if the army
couldn't win the battle before Rusty
Wren came home, all would be lost. For
no army of ants could stand and fight
such a monster as he.</p>

<p>"I have it!" the General cried at last.
"I've thought of the very thing....
Bring some stepladders!"</p>

<h3>DADDY ESCAPES</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">That</span> was a fine idea of General Antenna's&mdash;that
plan of bringing stepladders,
so that the ant army might climb up on
them and reach Daddy Longlegs, whom
they were attacking.</p>

<p>And Captain Kidd told the General on
the spot that it was a most happy
thought.</p>

<p>"Then do as I tell you, at once!" the
General ordered pompously.</p>

<p>"I can't!" said Captain Kidd, who was
terribly frightened, because the General
was sure to be angry.</p>

<p>"<i>Can't!</i>" cried General Antenna fierce<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_91" id="p_91">p. 91</a></span>ly.
"<i>Can't!</i> What do you mean,
madam?" (Perhaps you did not know
that Captain Kidd was a lady, as were
also the General and the whole army,
too!)</p>

<p>Captain Kidd's voice broke as she stammered
an answer to General Antenna's
rude demand.</p>

<p>"I know of only one stepladder in
Pleasant Valley," she explained. "It
belongs to Farmer Green. And it's so
heavy that the whole army couldn't
move it."</p>

<p>At that a shudder passed over General
Antenna's fat body.</p>

<p>"Then we're as good as lost!" she
shrieked. "Daddy Longlegs will defeat
us. And I'll never hear the last of it."</p>

<p>And right there on the edge of the battle-field
General Antenna shed so many
bitter tears that Captain Kidd had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_92" id="p_92">p. 92</a></span>
move aside slightly, to keep her feet from
getting wet.</p>

<p>"Don't weep!" cried the Captain in a
husky voice. "It's not your fault&mdash;really!"</p>

<p>"Whose is it, then?" asked the General
brokenly.</p>

<p>"Why, Farmer Green is to blame, of
course!" Captain Kidd replied. "If he
hadn't made his stepladder so big we
might have used it and won the battle
just as easily as not."</p>

<p>"That's so!" the General agreed, drying
her tears on a lace handkerchief.
"And from this time forth, Farmer
Green and I are deadly enemies!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile the battle still raged furiously.
But Daddy Longlegs had not received
a single wound. And perceiving,
at last, that he was quite unharmed, he
took heart again.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_93" id="p_93">p. 93</a></span>Finally it occurred to him that the ant
army was totally unable to reach him,
borne high in the air as he was by his
long legs. And as his fear left him, he
could think of no reason why he should
stay where he was any longer.</p>

<p>Accordingly he pulled himself together
and began to walk away. He moved
right through the ant army; and the
soldiers were powerless to stop him.</p>

<p>Just then General Antenna happened
to glance over the battle-field. And her
sad look at once gave way to one of great
joy. She even gave Captain Kidd a
hearty slap on the back&mdash;much to that
lady's distress (because it knocked her
cap awry).</p>

<p>"Look!" cried the General. "We've
won the battle after all; for the enemy is
retreating! Daddy Longlegs is running
away!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_94" id="p_94">p. 94</a></span>Hurrying off then, General Antenna
joined her army, and told her soldiers
that they had shown themselves to be
very brave, and that as a reward they
might each have an extra drink of milk
that night with their supper.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the ant
colony that evening. And General Antenna
caused the news of the victory to
be carried throughout Pleasant Valley.</p>

<p>But when he heard it, after he reached
home, Daddy Longlegs laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"Why, they never touched me!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<h3>LOST&mdash;A JACKKNIFE!</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Johnnie Green</span> couldn't find his new
jackknife anywhere. Since it was the
third knife Johnnie had lost that summer,
anyone might think that he
wouldn't have cared much, being so used
to losing jackknives.</p>

<p>But Johnnie had been particularly
proud of that knife. It had two blades,
a small saw, a corkscrew, a gimlet, a
leather-punch, and a hook for pulling a
stone out of the hoof of the old horse
Ebenezer.</p>

<p>Johnnie had worked in the hayfield on
many hot days to earn enough to buy<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_96" id="p_96">p. 96</a></span>
that knife. So it was no wonder that he
wanted to find it. He hunted for it carefully&mdash;in
the woodshed (where he had
gone for an armful of wood), in the
barn (where he had helped milk the cows
that morning), and under the big oak in
the dooryard (into which he had chased
the cat). And not finding his knife in
any of those places, he went into the pantry,
for he remembered getting some
jam and cookies there between breakfast
and dinner-time.</p>

<p>The jackknife was not in the pantry.
Johnnie even looked for it inside the
cookie-jar. And failing to find the knife
there, he consoled himself by taking
three more cookies. Then he slipped out
of the house and sat down behind the
stone wall to enjoy his lunch.</p>

<p>All the time he was munching his cookies
Johnnie Green was trying to recall<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_97" id="p_97">p. 97</a></span>
exactly what he had done and where he
had been since he jumped out of bed that
morning. If there was any place he had
forgotten, he intended to go there at once
and look for his lost jackknife.</p>

<p>Having swallowed the last crumb of
his goodies, Johnnie leaned back against
the stone wall and closed his eyes in
thought. He wondered if there wasn't
some out-of-the-way nook he had visited
that day.</p>

<p>As he sat there, something tickled his
ear. Then it tickled his cheek&mdash;and
finally his nose.</p>

<p>Johnnie Green couldn't help sneezing.
And opening his eyes, whom should he
see but Daddy Longlegs, standing on the
tip of his nose.</p>

<p>"My goodness!" Daddy exclaimed
when Johnnie Green sneezed. "I didn't
think the wind was going to blow to-day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_98" id="p_98">p. 98</a></span>
But there's an awful blast! I'd better
hurry home at once."</p>

<p>He had scarcely turned to go back
where he came from when Johnnie sat
up; and seizing his visitor quickly&mdash;but
carefully&mdash;Johnnie removed him from
his perch and held him, a captive, in his
hands.</p>

<p>When he stepped from a stone to Johnnie's
head Daddy Longlegs had no idea
that he was not walking on another stone.
Who would have expected to find the
head of a boy lying motionless against a
wall?</p>

<p>As soon as he recovered from his surprise,
Daddy Longlegs struggled to escape.
But his captor guarded him with
great pains.</p>

<p>"You don't think I'm going to let you
get away, do you?" Johnnie Green asked
him.</p>

<h3>JUST A NOTION</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> common with all the other youngsters
that went to school in the little red school-house,
Johnnie Green thought that Daddy
Longlegs and every one of his relations
had a strange power.</p>

<p>Yes! Johnnie believed that if you happened
to be lost in the woods, you would
need only to find Daddy Longlegs&mdash;or
one of his cousins&mdash;and he would point
out the way home for you, if you asked
him. Or if you wanted to recover something
you had lost, you could surely find
it with the help of any one of Daddy
Longlegs' family.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_100" id="p_100">p. 100</a></span>So that was the reason why Johnnie
Green was glad to see Daddy just at that
time. Having lost his new jackknife,
Johnnie was determined that Daddy
should tell him where to find it.</p>

<p>"Now, you listen to me!" Johnnie commanded,
frowning severely at Daddy.
"I've dropped my knife somewhere and
you must point towards it if you want me
to let you go.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it's like," he continued,
"so you won't make any mistake.
It has two blades, and a saw, and a corkscrew,
and a gimlet, and a leather-punch,
and a hook to use on a horse's hoof. It's
the best knife I've ever owned. And I'd
be pretty angry if you sent me off the
wrong way to find a jackknife that wasn't
nearly so good."</p>

<p>Now, Daddy Longlegs was angry himself.
He thought that Johnnie Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_101" id="p_101">p. 101</a></span>
had no business to make him a prisoner.
And as for knowing where the lost knife
was, he hadn't the faintest idea where
it could be.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you anything about your
old jackknife!" Daddy cried. (It was
really a new knife, as Johnnie had explained
to him. But you must remember
that Daddy Longlegs was in a terrible
temper.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately Daddy's voice was entirely
too tiny for Johnnie Green to hear.
And meanwhile Daddy continued to tug
and twist, trying to free himself from
Johnnie Green's grasp. His eight legs
kept reaching out in all directions for
firmer footholds.</p>

<p>Silly Johnnie Green thought that he
was trying to point the way to the missing
knife!</p>

<p>"Stop!" Johnnie cried. "Take your<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_102" id="p_102">p. 102</a></span>
time and don't get excited! If you keep
motioning with all your legs at once you
can't expect me to understand what you
mean."</p>

<p>Soon after that Daddy became quieter,
though it was only because he grew tired
from his efforts to escape. But he was so
angry and so worried that one of his legs
kept twitching; and it felt so queer that
Daddy Longlegs had to stretch it again
and again.</p>

<p>"Ah! That's better!" Johnnie Green
exclaimed then. "Now you're pointing
plainly enough. I know now that you're
trying to tell me to walk right towards
the sweet apple tree if I want to find my
knife. And I'm obliged to you, Mr. Daddy
Longlegs! Thank you very much!"</p>

<p>Then Johnnie let go his prisoner, who
crept quickly into a crevice of the stone
wall, where he stayed for a long time.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_103" id="p_103">p. 103</a></span>As for Johnnie Green, he scrambled
spryly over the wall and began to move
in a bee line toward the sweet apple tree.
He walked slowly and searched the
ground with great care. But he saw no
sign of his precious knife.</p>

<p>Beneath the sweet apple tree Johnnie
paused mournfully.</p>

<p>"He was only fooling me!" he exclaimed.
"That old Daddy Longlegs
played a trick on me!"</p>

<p>Johnnie just couldn't help feeling disappointed.
And he just couldn't help
feeling hungry as well. Luckily there
were apples on the old tree. So he began
to shin up into its branches.</p>

<p>And then all at once he saw his beautiful
knife sticking into the tree-trunk
right before his eyes.</p>

<p>Johnnie remembered then that he had
visited the sweet apple tree soon after<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_104" id="p_104">p. 104</a></span>
breakfast that very day, when he had
happened to feel hungry. And he had
stuck the knife there himself and gone
off and forgotten it.</p>

<p>With a shout of joy he gripped its horn
handle and pulled it out.</p>

<p>"Old Daddy Longlegs knew what he
was about after all!" he shouted.</p>

<p>And Johnnie Green never guessed that
his finding his jackknife was nothing but
an accident. Daddy had never even seen
it. And if he had, he wouldn't have
known what it was.</p>

<p>But after that Johnnie was more convinced
than ever that Daddy Longlegs
had a strange power.</p>

<h3>WHY DADDY WAS CHANGED</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was after his adventure with Johnnie
Green that Daddy Longlegs' neighbors
first noticed something queer about him.</p>

<p>They knew that he was not the same.
But strangely enough, no two of them
could agree as to what had changed him.
Chirpy Cricket said that he thought that
Daddy was wearing a new coat, for his
coat-tails seemed to flap differently when
he walked. Buster Bumblebee claimed
that Daddy had bought himself a new
hat which tipped at an unusual angle.
And little Mrs. Ladybug insisted that
Daddy's odd look was due to nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_106" id="p_106">p. 106</a></span>
more or less than some new checked
trousers. She remembered (she said)
that he had always worn striped ones
before.</p>

<p>Those were the opinions of only three
of Daddy's friends. It seemed as if
everybody in Pleasant Valley had his
own idea about the reason why Daddy
was changed.</p>

<p>Naturally, many disputes arose, because
everyone declared that his own notion
was the right one. And at last several
excited persons went to old Mr. Crow
and asked him to settle the trouble.</p>

<p>But Mr. Crow would have nothing to
do with the affair. He did not like
Daddy Longlegs. And he said he preferred
not to think about him at all.</p>

<p>That was something of a setback for
the company, until somebody said, "Let's
go and ask Solomon Owl! There's no<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_107" id="p_107">p. 107</a></span>
one in Pleasant Valley that looks so wise
as he!"</p>

<p>So they hurried off to the hemlock
woods where Solomon Owl lived. He
was at home. And he listened carefully
to each of his callers&mdash;although they all
talked at once.</p>

<p>At last he shouted loudly for silence,
though it was some time before he had it.</p>

<p>"Hush! hush!" some of the quieter
ones said. "We want to hear what wise
Mr. Solomon Owl says."</p>

<p>And then Solomon Owl spoke:</p>

<p>"If you want to know what's the matter
with Daddy Longlegs why don't you
go and ask him?"</p>

<p>Everybody exclaimed at once that that
was a splendid plan. And thanking Mr.
Owl for his excellent advice, the party
hurried away.</p>

<p>When they reached the stone wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_108" id="p_108">p. 108</a></span>
later, they found Daddy Longlegs sunning
himself. He seemed glad to see his
callers. And when they asked him what
it was that made him appear different,
he threw back his head, as far as he
could, and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;don't you know?" he said.
"Can't you see I've lost a leg?"</p>

<p>Daddy's news made everyone gasp.
And for a few moments not a soul could
speak. But the callers all stared at
Daddy. And then each one of them began
to count aloud: "One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were counting Daddy's legs. And
after they had counted seven they all saw
that his eighth leg was missing&mdash;that is,
all but Buster Bumblebee. Being a blundering
sort of person, he made a mistake
and counted one leg twice. But the other
callers soon set him right.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_109" id="p_109">p. 109</a></span>"It's no wonder you look different,"
Daddy's friends began telling him. "How
did you meet with such an awful accident?"</p>

<p>"I lost my leg trying to escape from
Johnnie Green," Daddy explained.
"Either he pulled the leg off my body, or
I pulled my body off the leg&mdash;I haven't
been able to decide which way it happened."</p>

<p>"You must miss your leg terribly!"
several of the company cried.</p>

<p>"Not at all!" replied Daddy Longlegs
cheerfully, to the great surprise of all
those present. "I have seven legs left;
and that ought to be enough for anybody.
I should think."</p>

<p>But little Mrs. Ladybug couldn't help
shuddering. "I think it's just too dreadful!"
she cried. "Johnnie Green is a very
careless boy."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_110" id="p_110">p. 110</a></span>"Oh, he didn't mean any harm, I
know," Daddy Longlegs assured her.
"He tried not to injure me.... But
I'll admit there's one thing that has
caused me a good deal of annoyance."</p>

<p>"What's that?" everyone asked.</p>

<p>"I had to get a new pair of seven-legged
trousers," Daddy Longlegs explained.
"And if any of you has ever
tried to find such a garment at short notice
he will understand that I've been in
great trouble."</p>

<p>Then Daddy Longlegs wished his callers
a pleasant afternoon and begged to be
excused, on account of important business.</p>

<p>And as they watched him walk briskly
away his neighbors all agreed that for a
person who had just lost a leg he seemed
wonderfully spry.</p>

<h3>A NEW NAME FOR DADDY</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs'</span> neighbor, little Mr.
Chippy, had an idea. And since he
thought it a good one he at once arranged
a meeting of a number of his
friends who lived near him.</p>

<p>Among those present were Buster
Bumblebee, Betsy Butterfly, Rusty Wren,
and several others. They met in Farmer
Green's apple orchard. And they all arrived
there early because everybody was
eager to know what Mr. Chippy had
to say.</p>

<p>"My idea&mdash;&mdash;" Mr. Chippy began&mdash;&mdash;"my
idea is this: since Daddy Longlegs is<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_112" id="p_112">p. 112</a></span>
so changed, after losing one of his legs,
we really ought to call him by a different
name. Now that he has only seven legs&mdash;instead
of eight&mdash;it doesn't seem polite
to say anything about <i>legs</i> in his hearing."</p>

<p>As Mr. Chippy paused and looked
about him the whole company agreed that
his idea was an excellent one.</p>

<p>"But I don't know where we're going
to find a new name for him," said Buster
Bumblebee, who never had many ideas
of his own.</p>

<p>"That's easy!" Mr. Chippy told him.
"I've thought of a splendid name. And
I'm perfectly willing to let you use it.... It's
<i>Grandfather Graybeard</i>!"</p>

<p>Most of the company clapped their
hands when Mr. Chippy said that. But
Buster Bumblebee spoke up and said that
he didn't think much of that name, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_113" id="p_113">p. 113</a></span>cause
Daddy Longlegs had no beard.</p>

<p>"Well, for all you know he may decide
to wear one, any day," Mr. Chippy replied.</p>

<p>And then all the company applauded
again&mdash;except Buster Bumblebee.</p>

<p>"How do you know Daddy Longlegs is
a grandfather?" he asked Mr. Chippy.</p>

<p>"How do you know he isn't?" Mr.
Chippy asked <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>And then everybody but Buster cried
out that "Grandfather Graybeard" was
a fine name for Daddy Longlegs. And
many remarked that Daddy would be
greatly pleased when he heard the news.</p>

<p>"Thank you!" said Mr. Chippy, making
a low bow with his hand on his heart.
"And now if it is the pleasure of the
meeting I will go back to the stone wall
at once and tell Daddy Longlegs what we
have decided to do."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_114" id="p_114">p. 114</a></span>To Mr. Chippy's surprise a murmur
of dissent greeted his proposal.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Mr.
Chippy! "I thought you liked my idea."</p>

<p>"So we do!" Rusty Wren replied.
"But we think it would be better if we
<i>all</i> called on Daddy and explained to him
about the change."</p>

<p>"Very well!" little Mr. Chippy answered.
"The more the merrier! I'll be
the spokesman. And I will suggest that
we start for the stone wall right now, for
there's no time like the present, you
know."</p>

<p>Even Buster Bumblebee approved of
Mr. Chippy's retort. And with that
everybody started pell-mell for the stone
wall.</p>

<h3>A BRIDEGROOM</h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs</span> was taken entirely by
surprise. It was rather early in the
morning. And he had not expected callers&mdash;at
least not so many as suddenly appeared
at the stone wall where he was
usually to be found.</p>

<p>Luckily he was arrayed in his very
best clothes. Indeed, he was quite smartly
dressed&mdash;for him. A bright yellow scarf,
tied in a big bow beneath his chin,
made him look almost dandified. And he
was wearing a bottle-green coat, lined
with pink.</p>

<p>"Goodness!" said Buster Bumblebee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_116" id="p_116">p. 116</a></span>
"He looks like a bridegroom!" But his
companions all told him to hush, and not
to be disrespectful to his elders.</p>

<p>"Good morning!" said Mr. Chippy to
Daddy Longlegs. "We've come to tell
you some good news. We're going to call
you by a different name. And we hope
you'll like it."</p>

<p>"I hope so!" Daddy Longlegs echoed.
"What is it, please?"</p>

<p>"It's 'Grandfather Graybeard'!" little
Mr. Chippy informed him with an air of
pride.</p>

<p>"Why, that's a beautiful name!" Daddy
Longlegs cried, as a look of pleasure
crossed his face.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you think so," said Mr.
Chippy. "It's only fair to tell you that
I thought of it myself."</p>

<p>And then he called for "three cheers
for Grandfather Graybeard!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_117" id="p_117">p. 117</a></span>They gave them with a right good will.</p>

<p>And after the sound had died away Mr.
Chippy said something in a whisper to
Daddy.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Rusty Wren demanded.
"What's he talking about?"</p>

<p>"He thinks we ought to give three
cheers for him," Daddy Longlegs explained.</p>

<p>But before they had time to do that a
large lady bustled out from the stone
wall and walked straight up to Daddy
Longlegs. She was one of his own kind,
too. The whole company agreed to that,
afterwards; because they had all counted
her feet. And she had eight.</p>

<p>"What's this?" the newcomer demanded.
"What's going on here, I should
like to know?"</p>

<p>And Daddy Longlegs looked a bit uncomfortable
as he explained that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_118" id="p_118">p. 118</a></span>
a new name, and told her what it was.</p>

<p>"You haven't given your consent, I
hope?" she said.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have," Daddy replied
meekly.</p>

<p>"Then withdraw it at once!" she commanded
sharply. "I don't like this new
name at all."</p>

<p>Poor Daddy Longlegs looked as if he
wished he might sink into the ground and
vanish. But since he couldn't do that,
he stammered that he was much obliged
to his friends for their kindness, but he
really would have to insist that they call
him by his old name, and he hoped they
would understand.</p>

<p>But they didn't understand even then.
And the whole company stood silent, with
their mouths open, and watched Daddy
Longlegs follow the strange lady away.
She had beckoned to him. And he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="p_119" id="p_119">p. 119</a></span>
started after her without a word of protest.</p>

<p>His friends noticed that she was considerably
bigger than he was.</p>

<p>Well, they might have been standing
there yet if little Mrs. Ladybug hadn't
arrived just then, quite out of breath
from hurrying. And of course she
wanted to know what had happened.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake!" she cried, after she
had listened to the strange story. "Do
you mean to say you haven't heard the
news? Didn't you know that Daddy
Longlegs had a new wife? Naturally, a
<i>bride</i> wouldn't care to have her young
husband known as 'Grandfather Graybeard.'"</p>

<p>"Ah! But he's very old!" said little
Mr. Chippy.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Mrs. Ladybug
inquired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="p_120" id="p_120">p. 120</a></span>Mr. Chippy had to admit that he had
no means of knowing.</p>

<p>And then Mrs. Ladybug looked very
wise.</p>

<p>"I have reason to believe," she said
"that Daddy Longlegs is a much younger
person than we have always supposed."</p>
